<h3>In what order would they be placed in terms of how powerful they are?</h3>
<ol>
  <li><h4>Satoru Gojo (The strongest Sorcerer of the current era)</h4></li>
    
    <p>Satoru Gojo (Japanese: 五条 悟, Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a similar Curse, helping him become stronger while protecting other characters in the series.

      Gojo was designed by Gege Akutami to be a formidable yet endearing figure who is passionate about his students. He is voiced by Yūichi Nakamura in Japanese and Kaiji Tang in English in the animated adaptations by MAPPA.
      
      The character was well received by the media for his carefree nature and power shown when protecting his students, becoming the series’s breakout character. Furthermore, his role in the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was appreciated by the media due to his hidden depths such as his relationship with the antagonist Suguru Geto.

  <li><h4>Geto Suguru (Second to Gojo Satoru, he's also the strongest)</h4></li>
  <p>
    Suguru Geto (Japanese: 夏油 傑, Hepburn: Getō Suguru) is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen 0. Suguru Geto is a powerful sorcerer who was previously friends with Satoru Gojo. He seeks the Queen of Curses Rika Orimoto, who in turn is searching for the protagonist of the prequel series, Yuta Okkotsu. Geto also appears in the main series Jujutsu Kaisen series which, through flashbacks, further explores his friendship with Gojo and their eventual antagonism towards one another. In the main series, his corpse is controlled by Kenjaku (Japanese: 羂索, Hepburn: Kenjaku), an ancient sorcerer who uses the Cursed Technique of transplanting his brain into other bodies. Kenjaku's goal is to evolve humanity through Cursed Energy to create a new golden age of Jujutsu sorcery similar to the Heian period.

      Shinobu Sensui, an antagonist from Yoshihiro Togashi's manga series YuYu Hakusho, inspired Akutami to create Geto, wanting also to explore prejudice through his character. Kenjaku was influenced by Naruto antagonist Orochimaru, with both being immortal sorcerers who use vessels to continue living. In the anime adaptations of Jujutsu Kaisen, the character is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai in Japanese and Lex Lang in English.
      
      The character was praised by critics for his role in Jujutsu Kaisen 0, coming across as a striking villain in his fights against Yuta and his class, while also developing a deep relationship with Gojo upon the revelation of their connection. The revelation of Kenjaku controlling Geto's body in the main series resulted in mixed responses due to its effect on the narrative and Geto.</p>

  <li><h4>Shoko Ieri (The best sorcerer of the current era in terms of healing techniques)</h4></li>
  <p>Shoko Ieiri (家入 硝子, Ieiri Shoko) is a doctor at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School and former classmate of Satoru and Suguru Geto. She has proven to be quite a valuable resource, being one of the few people capable of healing others with the Reverse Healing Cursed Technique. Shoko is a rather serious and somber person, wants nothing more than to get her job done, and often has to stop or get in the middle of Satoru to make fun of others. She usually examines dead bodies in the school morgue and does not engage in combat, unlike the other sorcerers. During the Shinjuku Showdown, she heals many of the combatants injured by Sukuna, with Utahime, Arata and Amai's help. She also helps Okkotsu transplant his brain into Gojo's corpse with Kenjaku's technique.</p>
